## GAS-1: Empty blocks should be removed or emit something

### Description

The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting.

## GAS-2: Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked payable

### Description

If a function modifier such as onlyOwner is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided.

### Affected file

* Conduit.sol (Line: 92, 127, 154)

## GAS-3: Internal functions not called by the contract should be removed to save deployment gas

### Description

If the functions are required by an interface, the contract should inherit from that interface and use the override keyword.

## GAS-4: Replace modifier with function

### Description

Modifiers make code more elegant, but cost more than normal functions.

### Affected file

* Conduit.sol (Line: 40)

## GAS-5: Storage pointer to a structure is cheaper than copying each value of the structure into memory, same for array and mapping

### Description

It may not be obvious, but every time you copy a storage struct/array/mapping to a memory variable, you are literally copying each member by reading it from storage, which is expensive. And when you use the storage keyword, you are just storing a pointer to the storage, which is much cheaper.

* BasicOrderFulfiller.sol (Line: 206)
* ConsiderationBase.sol (Line: 200, 212, 225, 260)

## GAS-6: Using private rather than public for constants saves gas

### Description

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where itâ€™s used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table.
